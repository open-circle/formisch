# Changelog

All notable changes to the library will be documented in this file.

## v0.10.0 (June 21, 2026)

- Change `@formisch/core` to v0.9.0
- Add `keepEdited` config option to the `reset` method to keep the edited state of fields
- Rename `getAllErrors` method to `getDeepErrors` and add an optional `path` config to scope error collection to a specific field's subtree (issue #135)
- Add `getDeepErrorEntries` method to retrieve the errors of a form or specific field as a list of path and message entries (issue #135)
- Add `isValid`, `isDirty`, `isTouched` and `isEdited` methods to check whether a form or a specific field is valid, dirty, touched or edited
- Change `insert`, `move`, `remove`, `replace` and `swap` methods to set the edited state of the field array
- Fix `replace` and `insert` to keep a non-nullish array, object or tuple consistent with the initial form state instead of `undefined` when its key is omitted (issue #139)

## v0.9.0 (June 15, 2026)

- Change `@formisch/core` to v0.8.0
- Fix `reset` method to apply a new `initialInput` to nullish array and object fields
- Fix `insert` and `replace` methods to no longer crash when an item's initial input contains a nested array with more items than the existing field stores
- Fix `setInput` method so growing an array after it was shrunk no longer resurfaces stale state from removed items and still detects changed values as dirty
- Change field array methods to reject fixed-length tuple paths at the type level, since a tuple's fixed arity makes operations like `insert` and `remove` invalid
- Fix `focus` method to focus the first element that can actually receive focus, skipping detached, disabled or hidden elements
- Fix `validate` and `handleSubmit` methods to focus the first field with an error and a focusable element, and to reset the validating state if validation throws

## v0.8.0 (May 24, 2026)

- Add `pickDirty` method to filter an externally-supplied value down to its dirty parts using the form's dirty mask (issue #21, pull request #98)
- Add `getDirtyPaths` method to list the paths of dirty fields in a form or specific field (issue #21, pull request #98)
- Add `getDirtyInput` method to retrieve only the dirty input values of a form or specific field (issue #21, pull request #98)
- Change `@formisch/core` to v0.7.0
- Change method generic constraints from `Schema` to `FormSchema` so the form root must be an object schema (sync or async) or a combinator (`intersect`, `union`, `variant`)

## v0.7.2 (May 17, 2026)

- Change `@formisch/core` to v0.6.4
- Fix `reset` method to apply falsy and explicit `undefined` values when resetting the initial input of a specific field (issue #78)

## v0.7.1 (April 16, 2026)

- Fix `insert` method to initialize missing target child slots when shifting array items (pull request #76)
