# reset

Resets the form or a specific field to its initial state or to a new initial input. Optionally keeps certain states like input values, touched state, or errors.

```ts
reset(form);
reset<TSchema, TFieldPath>(form, config);
```

## Generics

- `TSchema` <Property {...properties.TSchema} />
- `TFieldPath` <Property {...properties.TFieldPath} />

## Parameters

- `form` <Property {...properties.form} />
- `config` <Property {...properties.config} />

### Explanation

When called without a config or with `path` set to `undefined`, the entire form is reset. When a `path` is provided, only that specific field and its nested fields are reset.

By default, the form resets to its original initial input. However, you can pass a new `initialInput` in the config to update the form's baseline data. This is useful when remote data has changed and the form needs to reflect the updated values. Combined with `keepInput`, `keepTouched`, `keepErrors`, and `keepSubmitted`, you can update the initial state without overwriting the user's current edits.

#### More context on dirty tracking

Formisch distinguishes between two concepts:

- **Initial input**: the baseline value used for dirty tracking (often the server state).
- **Current input**: the value the user is currently editing (the client state).

Calling `reset` updates the initial input (baseline). Depending on the `keep*` options, it can also overwrite the current input, or keep it and just recompute state like `isDirty` based on the new baseline.

> If the initial input is `null` or `undefined`, Formisch does not treat an empty string or `NaN` as dirty. This helps when HTML inputs produce `''` or `NaN` for "empty" values.
